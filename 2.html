He was then traded to the Dallas Mavericks in exchange for the draft rights to Trae Young and a protected future first-round pick in 2019.After the draft, Mavericks head coach Rick Carlisle said, "At one point, we thought there might be a slight chance Dončić could fall to us, but a couple of days ago it was pretty clear that there was no way that was going to happen. He's just too good. We get a guy we think is franchise foundation piece." He signed his rookie contract with the Mavericks on July 9, 2018.Dončić did not play at the 2018 NBA Summer League due to his late buyout from Real Madrid.Before the 2018–19 season, ESPN considered him the favorite to win the NBA Rookie of the Year Award.
